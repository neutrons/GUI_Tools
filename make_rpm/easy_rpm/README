To make a simple tar file 

the setup.py file must look like this

'''
from distutils.core import setup

setup(name = 'my_addition',
      scripts=['scripts/my_addition'],
      version = '1.0',
      author = 'Jean Bilheux',
      packages = ['code','scripts'])
'''

and then
> python setup.py sdist


To make a RPM file
> python setup.py bdist_rpm

To install RPM (as sudo)
> cd dist/
> rpm -ivh my_addition-1.0-1.noarch.rpm

To run the program
> cd /usr/bin
> my_add
Sum of 5.0000 and 6.0000 is 11.0000

To remove installed RPM (as sudo)
> rpm -ev my_addition-1.0-1.noarch
